## <p align="center"> Algorithm of Analysis individual project #1 - Range searching algorithm </p>


This project is comprised of three major sections.

### 1. Point Generator.
  * Generates arbiturary points in incremental order.
      * Matrix dimesion determined by users input.
      * Matrix starting from 100 * 2 ^ n, where n = 1, 2, 3, 4... (Each of the matrix length is identical)
      * Experimental number of points generated 600 * n, where n = 1, 2, 3, 4...
      * Each generated points are save in .dat file named like: "POINTS_*MATRIX LENGTH*_*NUMBER OF POINTS*.dat
      
### 2. Data structures.
  * Sequential structure.
    * insert()
    * find()
    
  * KD-Tree Structure.
    * insert()
    * find()

### 3. Result exportation.
